FreeDay 
-------

FreeDay is an activities coordinating application. It helps facilitate making decisions as to when would be the best time for a group of people to meet, and what to do when they finally do meet. 

FreeDay was made by [Lisa Wells][lw], [Clayton Albachten][ca], [Crawford Forbes][cf], [Heidi Williams-Foy][hw] and [Brenda Dargan-Levy][bd] over the course of a long weekend, as part of General Assembly's Web Developer's Immersive.
